wp-bodyclass
============

Body Class (body_class) is a WordPress function that gives the body element different classes, so theme authors can style their sites effectively with CSS. 
When coding a theme, you can attach the body_class function to your body element like so:

[<body <?php body_class($class); ?>>]
