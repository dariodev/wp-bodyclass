wp-bodyclass
============

Body Class (body_class) is a WordPress function that gives the body element different classes, so theme authors can style their sites effectively with CSS. 
When coding a theme, you can attach the body_class function to your body element like so:

<?php body_class($class); ?>

Description: Enhances the body_class adding some extra classes to the body (post/page slugs, post categories, archive parent categories, multisite id and user role name) useful in developing custom themes.
